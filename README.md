# Library-Management-System-C
This project is a Library Management System implemented in C language. It provides a simple way to manage library operations such as: Add books, Display books, Search books (by ID or name),  Issue/borrow books, Return books, Delete a book, Save and load data (using file handling so data persists after program exits)
It is a console-based application, created as a beginner-friendly project to practice C programming, structures, functions, and file operations.
